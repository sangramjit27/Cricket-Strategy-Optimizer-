# Cricket Strategy Optimizer

## Overview

Cricket Strategy Optimizer is an AI and data-driven system designed to assist teams and analysts in **optimizing cricket strategies**. By leveraging historical match data, player statistics, probabilistic and situational analysis, the project demonstrates how machine learning and statistical modeling can inform tactical decisions, from batting order to bowling plans.This system focuses on pre-match and post-match analysis, ensuring it remains an ethical tool for performance enhancement without providing live recommendations during matches.

This repository contains a **sanitized academic version** for educational purposes. No proprietary or live match data is included.

## Key Features

* Analysis of player performance and match statistics
* Optimization of batting orders and bowling strategies
* Match scenario simulations for tactical insights
* Modular and extensible framework for further experimentation

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Machine Learning (scikit-learn, XGBoost)
* Data Analysis and Visualization (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Optional: Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis

## Project Structure

* `src/` – source models for analysis and strategy optimization demo
* `docs/` – project documentation dataset, results and requirements.txt

## Confidentiality Notice

All datasets, analysis methods, and implementations are **generalized** and intended strictly for educational and demonstration purposes.
